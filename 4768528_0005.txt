STATEMENT ΟΝ ΒυΡΙ-ΙῦΑΤΕ iMAGES

This reei oi miorofiim contains materiai
which hes paper coior changes, stains or
illustrations (some of witich may appear on
peges mixed witi] printed text). in order to

ensure thet aii text and illustratione, are
ieqibie, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore‚ when text erici illustrations exist
in e single image or when materiei
baokorourtds differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects tite camera
operator’s best effort to capture the majority
oi the text; the second exposure refiects the

camere operator’s best effort to capture

iilustrative materiai or the remaining] text. ἡ it
is hoped that this practice wiii resuit in a

microfiim product that fuiiy serves trie needs
of most reseerohers.
